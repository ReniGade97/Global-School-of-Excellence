										<h5>What is Giftedness?</h5>
<p id="para">It is very important to know that: intellectual giftedness can be
described as the intelligent ability that is significantly higher than
the average intelligence. It is also classified as that special
characteristic that children possess, requiring them to be very
motivated highlighting major differences in school programme. In
addition, intellectual giftedness can also include high ability, or
specific abilities.
Furthermore, IQ tests can be used to determine the ability of
children. Depending on the type of test that is used: mildly gifted
children score from 115 to 129, moderately individuals achieve a score
of 130 to 144, highly gifted persons score range from 145 to 159,
while, exceptional gifted individuals score from 160 to 179, and
profoundly gifted children score somewhere within the range of 180.
Also, gifted children are those individuals who show high performance
capability in areas such as: intellectual, creativity, artistic,
leadership capacity, or specific academic fields, and who require
services or activities not usually provided in the regular schools in
order to fully develop their capabilities.
While it is the belief of some persons that giftedness can be achieved
through the process of nurturing, however, the overwhelming consensus
states that it is present at birth, an inherited trait. In addition,
the chances are very high, that if one, or both parents are gifted,
there is the strong likelihood that a child, or siblings will also be
gifted.</p></br>
<h5>Listed are some of the common characteristics of a gifted child:</h5>
<ul>
											<li><a>Unusual alertness, even in infancy. </a></li>
											<li><a>Rapid learner; puts thoughts together quickly </a></li>
											<li><a>Excellent memory </a></li>
											<li><a>Unusually large vocabulary and complex sentence structure for age</a></li>
											<li><a> Advanced comprehension of word nuances, metaphors and abstract ideas </a></li>
											<li><a>Enjoys solving problems, especially with numbers and puzzles </a></li>

										</ul>

<p>Therefore, let the Global School of Excellence for Gifted Students be
the ideal school for developing and nurturing the minds of your gifted
and talented students.</p>
